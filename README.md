# Stasis

A timeless take on benchmarking LLMs, just like grounding people after waking up from stasis in deep space

## Background

Similar to most sci-fi stories, when a crew aboard interstellar vehicles is awakened from stasis, they "have to" start vomiting and need grounding about their location, time, and the status of online/offline systems. I'm halfway through _Alien: Cold Forge_.

The same is applicable to LLMs as well, if we are to treat them as cognition engines instead of being relegated as a bunch of stochastic parrots. This also means that benchmarks like [GAIA](https://huggingface.co/papers/2311.12983) & others need to be re-worked from a timeless human's perspective. Where all notion of current space-time, tools available, data sources, localization etc. is jettisoned & needs to be re-introduced/affirmed back to them. 

This project also assumes ```English``` to somehow become the timeless language or atleast interpreted without any formal rules being shared between LLM & benchmark (unifying translation is for another project), thereby banking on the pre-training to have resolved this. Just like we bootstrap & learn basic phrases in a language before formally being taught the same.
