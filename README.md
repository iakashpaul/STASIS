# STASIS
A timeless take on benchmarking LLMs, just like grounding people after waking up from stasis in deep space

## Background

Just like most sci-fi stories, when a crew on-board interstellar vehicles is awoken from stasis. They start puking & need to be grounded about where they are, when they are & what systems are online/offline etc. I'm currently half way through _Alien: Cold Forge_.

The same is applicable to LLMs as well, if we are to treat them as cognition engines instead of being relegated as a bunch of stochastic parrots. This also means that benchmarks like [GAIA benchmark](https://huggingface.co/papers/2311.12983) & others need to be re-worked from a timeless human's perspective. Where all notion of current space-time, tools available, data sources, proprioception/localization etc. is jettisoned & needs to be re-introduced/affirmed back to them. 

This project also assumes ```English``` to somehow be the timeless language or atleast interpreted without any formal rules being shared between LLM & benchmark (unifying translation is for another project), thereby banking on the pretraining to have resolved this exactly like how we bootstrap & learn basic skills in a language before formally being taught the same.

Come to think of it this could also be used to verify intelligence(human level atleast) in other forms of life, terrestrial or extra-terrestrial (if such a time might ever arrive).
